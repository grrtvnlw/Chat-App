## What It Is
Hi Letâ€™s Chat is a full-stack app that uses web sockets to pass data between the client-side and server-side. The app includes
features such as the ability to detect what users are online, when a user is typing, and private chat. This project was my first experience using web sockets and the app was built with the Socket.IO library.
