## What It Is
Hi Letâ€™s Chat is a full-stack app that uses web sockets to pass data between the client-side and server-side. The app includes
features such as the ability to detect what users are online, when a user is typing, and private chat. 

I used Node.js and Express to handle the routing for this app and the Socket.IO library to implement web sockets. I also used the Embedded JavaScript view engine to render HTML templates.
